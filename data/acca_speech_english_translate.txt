Vanakkam.
My name is Vaithegi.
I am Appamma's third child.
I would like to say a few words about Appamma.
Appamma has a very important thing in her life and that is her children.
She loves them a lot.
She loves them fiercely.
That was her focus in life.
In that sense she is quite blessed because she passed away at 92 and she was able to
see her children's lives over many years and see how it unfolds.
She has six children and she has ten grandchildren in total.
She was there for the wedding of my three grandchildren.
Of those three children, one of them, two of them are her great grandchildren.
She has the opportunity to see that and it is quite rare.
She saw the progression of her children's lives.
I think she is quite blessed in that way.
She passed away peacefully with her son by her side in her own home.
I think that is a nice way to end her life.
I just want to thank everyone for being at the funeral.
I hope that it is an opportunity for everyone to connect and remember her and remember
all their lives together.
Thank you.
Welcome.
Thank you!
