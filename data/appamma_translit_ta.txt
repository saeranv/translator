 I have such a heavy heart knowing that you have parted ways with us, Appa Ma.
 When Appa came to see you, he would always send videos of you both smiling and laughing
 together, and it felt like distance could never keep us apart, despite us living all
 the way in New Zealand.
 To think that you even came and visited us from Canada lately, and endured the long flight
 makes my heart warm.
 I hope that you are resting well knowing that you have raised six successful children, as
 well as your many grandchildren that are lucky to have the opportunities we do.
 I hope to make you proud in the future as you watch down on all of us, always being
 in our hearts.
 Rest in peace, Appa Ma.
 I love you.
 Even if we part ways, it feels good to be together.
 Even if we part ways, it feels sad to be apart.
 I remember Appa Ma.
 Appa Ma would always smile and say, "Come here, son."

 Thank you for your blessings, Appa Ma.
 You have always wanted all of your grandchildren to be successful in life, and we will make
 sure that we fulfill your wish.
 Rest in peace, Appa Ma.
 You were hardworking and strong-willed to the very end.
 To raise six children shows the strength of your love and courage.
 You will always be remembered as the core of this family.
 Appa Ma, you will be sorely missed.
 The pride and dedication that you have shown to your family is unmatched, and the Thambi
 Raja family is successful across the globe because of all the sacrifices that you have
 made.
 I have so many fond memories of all the times that we have met each other.
 The way that you looked after your children, your grandchildren, and now your great-grandchildren.
 I still smile when I think about that loving angry scowl that you would give us when you
 tell us off, and the times that you would smile when you play with us.
 I am glad that you are in a better place now, and I am glad that you are with Periyappa
 looking down on us.
 I know that we will always be looking over us, and that we have someone to rely on when
 we are in need.
 Rest in peace, Appa Ma.
 I am Aspini, and I am one of the granddaughters.
 It is with great sadness that we say farewell to our beloved Appa Ma.
 She was a very special woman who was able to raise six amazing children all on her own
 after the early passing of her husband.
 The children live all over the world, and for that reason, Appa Ma was very well-travelled
 herself.
 I remember when Appa Ma travelled from Canada all the way to New Zealand to come and spend
 time with me and my family.
 My brothers and I enjoyed having her join our Amama and Periyama, as for us, they were,
 and still will be, despite their passing, significant figures in our life.
 Rest in peace, Appa Ma.
 We love you.
 Vanakkam, enne peyir vaideki.
 Nan Appa Ma ku mootha peyirr pillai.
 Na Appa Ma patee sira vaateyil solam anu vanna.
 Appa Ma ku vandu aval na life la very important anu oro desiyon na anu pillai.
 She loved them a lot.
 She loved them fiercely.
 That was her focus in life.
 In that sense, she's quite blessed because she passed away at 92 and she was able to
 see her children's lives over many years and see how it unfolds.
 Avaakka aaru pillai.
 Anu aaru pillai lakku total aavaku patthu pera pillai.
 Anu patthu pera pillai la avaku moondu pera pillai lakku kalyanatakku ava irundirukkara.
 And anu moondu pera pillai lakku la oru pera pillai lakku athu naan pillai.
 Renda pillai la avaku great-grandchildren.
 Aaveku poorthi.
 So anu vaayppam indu pillai lakku avakum kudachiru.
 Avaakka great-grandmother and it's quite rare.
 So, she saw the progression of her children's lives and so I think she's quite blessed in
 that way.
 She passed away peacefully with her son by her side in her own home.
 I think that's a nice way to end her life.
 So, I just want to thank everyone for being at the funeral.
 I hope that it's an opportunity for everyone to connect and remember her and remember all
 their lives together.
 So, thank you.
 Aavakum.
