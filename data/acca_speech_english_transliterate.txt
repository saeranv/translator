 Vanakkam, enne peyir vaideki.
 Nan Appa Ma ku mootha peyirr pillai.
 Na Appa Ma patee sira vaateyil solam anu vanna.
 Appa Ma ku vandu aval na life la very important anu oro desiyon na anu pillai.
 She loved them a lot.
 She loved them fiercely.
 That was her focus in life.
 In that sense, she's quite blessed because she passed away at 92 and she was able to
 see her children's lives over many years and see how it unfolds.
 Avaakka aaru pillai.
 Anu aaru pillai lakku total aavaku patthu pera pillai.
 Anu patthu pera pillai la avaku moondu pera pillai lakku kalyanatakku ava irundirukkara.
 And anu moondu pera pillai lakku la oru pera pillai lakku athu naan pillai.
 Renda pillai la avaku great-grandchildren.
 Aaveku poorthi.
 So anu vaayppam indu pillai lakku avakum kudachiru.
 Avaakka great-grandmother and it's quite rare.
 So, she saw the progression of her children's lives and so I think she's quite blessed in
 that way.
 She passed away peacefully with her son by her side in her own home.
 I think that's a nice way to end her life.
 So, I just want to thank everyone for being at the funeral.
 I hope that it's an opportunity for everyone to connect and remember her and remember all
 their lives together.
 So, thank you.
 Aavakum.
